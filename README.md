# Ham Radio Questions Study Aid

The National Conference of Volunteer Exam Coordinators (NCVEC) publishes [question pools](https://ncvec.org/index.php/amateur-question-pools) for those interested in studying for licensing exams. These question pools are downloadable in Micro$oft Word docx and appear to have been formatted with extensive use of line breaks.

What you will find here are the Technician and General question pool documents imported into LibreOffice and highlighted for study. They are available in Open Document (ODF) and as PDF exports.

In some cases, like the for General exam's regulation heavy questions, I have added mnemonics and other study aids at the end of sections.

Documents are being reworked to take advantage of LibreOffice styles, table of contents, and other features rather than depending on direct formatting and typewriter style line breaks. The idea is to avoid inconvenient page breaks in the middle of question/answer groups and to allow toggling of highlighting globally with a single style change.

To remove highlighting:
1. Open the original ODT document in LibreOffice
2. Select the menu option Styles > Manage Styles
3. Select the Character Styles tab
4. Expand Default Paragraph Font
5. Edit the Highlighting style and set color to None

Please Note:

* The study notes are mine. I'm studying for my exams too. I might have some incorrect information in here. Double-check everything.
