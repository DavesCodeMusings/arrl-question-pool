# ARRL Questions Study Guide
The Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) publishes [question pools](https://www.arrl.org/question-pools) for those interested in studying for licensing exams. The question pools are downloadable in Micro$oft Word docx and appear to have been formatted with extensive use of line breaks.

What you will find here are the same question pool documents imported into LibreOffice and highlighted for study, available in Open Document (ODF) and PDF exports.

Documents are slowly being reworked to take advantage of LibreOffice styles, table of contents, and other features rather than depending on typewriter style formatting.

The copywrite on the original documents is unstated. Please know what you find here is not my work, but simply a reformattting of the original ARRL documents.
