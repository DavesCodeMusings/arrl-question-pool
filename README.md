# ARRL Questions Study Aid

**Formatting is still a work in progress!**

The Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) publishes [question pools](https://www.arrl.org/question-pools) for those interested in studying for licensing exams. These question pools are downloadable in Micro$oft Word docx and appear to have been formatted with extensive use of line breaks.

What you will find here are the same question pool documents imported into LibreOffice and highlighted for study, available in Open Document (ODF) and PDF exports.

Documents are slowly being reworked to take advantage of LibreOffice styles, table of contents, and other features rather than depending on direct formatting and typewriter style line breaks. The idea is to avoid inconvenient page breaks in the middle of question/answer groups and to allow toggling of highlighting globally with a single style change.

To remove highlighting:
1. Open the original ODT document in LibreOffice
2. Select the menu option Styles > Manage Styles
3. Select Character Styles
4. Expand Default Paragraph Font
5. Edit the Highlighting style and set color to None

Please Note: The copyright on the original documents is unstated. What you find here is not my work, but simply a reformattting of the original ARRL documents.
