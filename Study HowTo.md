# License Exam Study HowTo
This is the method I used to study for the Technician and General exams at no cost.

## First round: Assess your knowledge.

1. Review the ARRL License Manual for the license level. (Check out from local library for no out-of-pocket cost.)
2. Skim the highlighted study guides available here to familiarize yourself with the questions.
3. Take a practice test at [ARRL's site](https://www.arrl.org/exam-practice) or [Ham Study](https://hamstudy.org/) (Both are no cost.)

The first time through you'll probably miss a few questions and maybe miss enough to risk not passing. That's okay. Use these missed questions to determine what areas you need to study more. Then move on to the second round of study.

## Second round: Fill in the gaps.
1. Use the ARRL license manual to review the chapters for questions you missed.
2. Retake the exam.
3. If you come across a question you're unsure of, search for the correct answer in the highlighted study guide.
4. Answer it correctly, but make a tally mark for the question you needed to look up.

Don't just blindly guess! It's okay to peek. This will reinforce the correct answer in your memory instead of a random wrong answer. Make sure you take time to review the license manual to understand why the answer is correct (and the process used to find it if it's a calculation.)

## Third round and beyond: Practice, practice, practice!
Continue taking practice exams until you no longer feel the need to peek at the answer sheet. Keep taking tests until you can get 100% at least once.

The practice exams use a random set of questions, so keep repeating to ensure you're exposed to as many questions as possible. Before taking the actual exam, you'll want to consistently get passing scores on practice tests. Ideally, you'll want to hit upper 90% or 100% most of the time.

## Memory aids for the win!
Most of the regulatory questions require rote memorization. You either know it or you don't. Make it easier on yourself by identifying some key words you can trigger on to lead you to the right answer.

For example, there is a question on the General Exam about which of the bands is divided into channels rather than frequency ranges.

To remember the answer, I think of cable television. I say to myself, "60 channels and nothing's on."

The answer to the exam question is: The 60 meter band is divided into channels. By remembering "60 channels and nothing's on," I'm associating the number 60 with channels.
